# deathless_E11 fit report (third sheet (R221 weapons, pass 2); RULEBOOK 5.15 and 5.16, ships.md 2c, R217 to R219)

Made by `tools/blender/build_sheets/clash.py` on the built blockout (it runs inside every `build.py ... render` and on its own
with `build.py <code> <out> fit`). What it tests, on every part of every type:

1. **CLASH**: no part intersects another part; no non-mount piece (barrel, bell, blade, lid, slat, lens) sits inside the hull.
   Mount pieces (rings, collars, plates, saddles, sunk tubes) may sit into the hull, never into another part.
2. **MOUNT**: every part touches the hull through a mount piece.
3. **ARC**: every gun, at every bearing of its data.js slot arc (core.js inArc: F 60 degrees either side of the bow, P and S
   30 to 150 off the bow, T all round, 5 degree steps), has a clear line at an elevation it can reach (turrets 0 to 30, flak
   0 to 60, casemates -10 to +20), out to 60 percent of the ship's length.
3b. **SENSOR** (R240): no gun sits behind or aims through a dish, antenna or mast: the gun's whole firing volume (every
   bearing of its slot arc, every elevation it can reach, out to 60 percent of the ship's length) misses every sensor piece's
   box padded by the gun's calibre; firing just over a dish is not enough.
4. **SWEEP** (R219): every turret's turning pieces turned through every bearing of its arc touch nothing; no two turrets meet
   when both turn through their arcs.
5. **EXHAUST**: nothing in any engine or thruster exhaust cone.
6. **EXIT**: no launcher cell, tube mouth, dish beam, hatch, lamp, vent or slit is covered.
7. **LANE** (R221: parts must not look like they conflict): each rack has a firing lane forward of its cells (4 degree spread,
   to 80 percent of the ship's length) and a backblast aft (15 degree spread, 2.5 rack depths or 15 percent of the length);
   no gun may sit in either, resting or turned through its slot arc, even when no mesh touches.
8. **Turret reach** (the issue 560 lesson: deck dressing can pin a turret): each turret is turned from rest each way in 5 degree
   steps until something stops it; the table below gives the real reach and flags any under 60 degrees either way.

Turret marking for issue 560 (R219): each turret is an empty named `<id>_turret` at the ring centre (local +Z = the mount
normal), with custom properties `turret=1`, `slot`, `weapon`, `arc_lo`, `arc_hi`, `arc_deg` (bearings from the bow, + to port, as
core.js inArc), `rest_yaw`, `rest_pitch`; its turning meshes `<id>_turn_<material>` are its children (mesh in the pivot frame,
also `turret=1`); its fixed ring and bolt ring `<id>_mount_<material>` stay on the hull. Casemates are single fixed parts
(`turret=0`, `gun_fixed=1`).


## How third sheet (R221 weapons, pass 2) fixed them

| Clash (before) | Fix |
|---|---|
| F1 (aft flak twin) intersecting HB1 (the deck housing), and sweeping through it from bearing -30 to 30 | the housing made shorter (0.5) and moved forward to 4.6 aft of amidships; the twin moved aft to 6.4, so its barrels clear the housing at every bearing |
| T1 (fore twin) firing aft blocked by T2's plinth at bearings 175 and -175 | T2 moved aft (to 57 percent) and T1 raised on a low round drum, so T1's highest line passes over T2's muzzles; both twins carry 2.0 barrels |

While designing, the check also caught (and the design fixed): deck hatches and the core port sunk in the curved tier, the belt lights inside the belt, heat panels covered by the stern feathers (moved forward of the band collar), the aft flak twin sweeping through deck hatches (moved to the deck edge), and, after the crescent was raised over the nose, the fore twin's barrels striking the tier when trained aft (the tier now starts behind its sweep). R221 weapon rebuild (this sheet): the new null cannons, shredders and corona arc emitter checked at zero on their first full run, with the new LANE test and the emitter's own firing lane.

## The sheet as delivered (after)

Counts: CLASH 0, MOUNT 0, ARC 0, SENSOR 0, SWEEP 0, EXHAUST 0, EXIT 0, LANE 0. Tested: 237 objects, 27 parts, 634 close pairs, 389 rays, 4 guns, 0 sensor pairs, 3 turrets swept, 7 cones, 15 apertures, 1 lanes.

**Zero clashes left.** No clash is left in as intended.

| Turret | Slot | Arc (bearings) | Sweep steps clear | Rest | Reach to port | Stopped by | Reach to starboard | Stopped by | Under 60 |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| T1 | T | -180 to 180 | 73 | 0 | all round | - | all round | - | no |
| T2 | T | -180 to 180 | 73 | 0 | all round | - | all round | - | no |
| F1 | T | -180 to 180 | 73 | 0 | all round | - | all round | - | no |

Reach is measured from the rest bearing, in degrees, turning toward port (bearings rising) and toward starboard; "all round" means nothing stops it within 180. Every turret clears its whole data.js slot arc (sweep steps above). Under 60 degrees either way: none.
